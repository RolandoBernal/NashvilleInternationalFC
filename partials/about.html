							<h1>About Us</h1>
							<p>​All started in 2008 when a couple of parents got together to establish Team Barcelona and so coach theirs sons and their sons' friends.</p>
							<p>They started playing on their neighborhood and decided to form a team and started participating in local leagues. At the beginning they were losing all their games but soon thereafter started to get better and better and now they are a very competitive team playing at the Division 2 level.</p>
